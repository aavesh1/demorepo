Artificial Intelligence-Based Classification of Chest X-Ray Images into COVID-19 and Other Infectious Diseases
As we know the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease(COVID-19) has led to global health and healthcare crisis,
One of the significant challenges in this crisis is to identify and monitor the COVID-19 patients quickly and efficiently to facilitate timely decisions for their treatment, monitoring, and management. 



This project is focused on developing less time-consuming methods to make identification of patients faster and efficient by creating efficient deep learning models, trained with chest X-ray images, for rapid screening of COVID-19 patients by using publicly available , labeled chest X-ray images of adult COVID-19 patients.

In the present study, I have made use of a deep learning algorithm using the convolutional neural network (CNN) that can efficiently detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images for swift diagnosis.

For the training and development of AI-based classification models, COVID-19, non-COVID-19 and normal chest X-ray images were downloaded from publically available sources.

# WHY DO WE NEED AN Artificial Intelligence-Based Classification of Chest X-Ray Images ?

In Pandemic times when our medical personnel are under a lot of stress ,  it is desirable to have a fast, cost-effective, user-friendly, noninvasive, and intelligent diagnostic method for rapid screening and early diagnosis of diseases, which also requires the least manual intervention. 
Timely diagnosis of the COVID-19 patients can enable help in the optimization of available resources, including trained human resources, for all the supportive measures required for confirmed patients. 

Automated AI-based intelligent chest X-ray classification has such untapped potential for this unmet need, if we give it a thought.
